1. Plz explain lines 8-64 --> all are missed due to jump 64 always... HOLY S*** DUDE YOU MADE A SWITCH STATEMENT?!? Amazing!
2. again line 80-137 --> code is never run... Mad lad implemented a switch. Wow!
3. Line 69 "jump x greaterThan n 1 --> always jumps
   Line 70 is never reached
4. despite these missed lines of code, it still works? Idk, magic. --> not magic, science baby!
5. Stops at Risso, also unable to spawn in Risso?
