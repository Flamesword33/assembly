Overarching goal, Matt wants to combine all files.

Turret control  --> commander
Kiting protocal --> all
Unit commander  --> finished product for commander
Unit army       --> finished product for army 

Kiting protocal:
Someone found way to make units backpedal and shoot. 
Please tell Matt how.

arc turret file: 
most of file is redundant only keep what pertains to arc turret

Last time he tried combining files the unit faced decision paralysis. Can process 1500 commands a second. 

Current files work but Matt wants a combine job.
